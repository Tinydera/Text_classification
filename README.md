# A school is trying to decide if they can use a writing test to understand which students may need to work on their motor skills at a young age
# They are testing this by having them write numbers and they want us to build a model to see if we can predict what they’ve drawn. 
# To accomplish this, they want you to use a simplistic approach (KNN) to start the research but also compare the results with something more complicated like neural networks to accomplish this week’s task.
